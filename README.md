# Interspeech_2024_Gender
This repository contrains additional plots and Figures for the Interspeech 2024 paper [On the Encoding of Gender in Transformer-based ASR Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09855).
Each of the directories point to the figures in the manuscript
1. ```scrub/``` contains the gender scrubbing plots for all datasets and models (Figure 1)
2. ```snapshot_probe/``` shows the same-position snapshot probe performance plots across layers for all datasets/models (Figure 2 (a,b))
3. ```cross_position_snapshots/``` shows probes trained and tested at different snapshot positions at each layer of the model (Figure 2(c))
